# SQL_Email_Marketing_Dashboard

## Purpose 
This project analyzes email marketing performance across 20 campaigns. Using SQL for data cleaning and exploration and Tableau for visualization, I evaluated engagement KPIs such as open rate, click rate, open-to-click efficiency, unsubscribe behavior, and signup trends over time. The goal was to identify what’s working, where engagement drops, and which campaigns drive the highest or lowest performance. Each SQL file in this folder has my SQL code with analysis from the data that was manipulated.

## Recomendations and Insights Based on Analysis
### Send Time Optimization
Best days to send: Thursday & Friday
Best times: 6:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and Thursday at 1:00 PM
Aim major campaigns around these peak engagement windows

### Signup Campaign Timing
Highest signups: January–March
Lowest signups: September–December
Focus signup/lead-gen emails early in the year

### User Segmentation Findings
Region and device type showed no meaningful differences in open, click, or unsubscribe rates.
No segmentation adjustments needed at this time

### Unsubscribe Behavior
Privacy concerns were the top unsubscribe reason across all campaigns.
Improve clarity around data usage, privacy statements, and email preferences

### Campaign Performance Review
Campaign 20: Longest time before users unsubscribed
Campaign 12: Shortest time before unsubscribes
Review the content/frequency of Campaign 12 to identify causes for early drop-off
